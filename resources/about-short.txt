- Separation of the logic (Java code) from presentation (XML markup)
- XSD-enforced XML UI declarations

1. Rapid Application Development
2. Rich collection of existing UI components
3. High level of aplication consistency

5. High level of Browsers compatibility

Cons:
1. massive javascript runtime (about 1 M. cached on browser)
